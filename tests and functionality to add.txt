- Machine tolerance is currently hard coded in probability as the cubed root of .Machine$double.eps = e^-52.  We need to test this on other computers to make sure this number isn’t still too small.  If it is too small, probability has the chance of equaling 1, which introduces many problems down the line of functions.

- We need to make it possible that when an answer says -1 (vs NA) the software recognizes that as the person chose not to answer the question.

- We need to deal with what happens for many of these functions when no item has been asked yet.

- Need to make sure all the while loops have a max number of iterations.. 200 would be good

- Need to work through MAP estimates and SE using alternative priors


Debug for Alex:
- Right now the Brent method has initial search interval set at [-5,5] because it was crashing R on the test dataset when set at [-6,6].  We need it to send an error/not crash when set at [-6,6].
