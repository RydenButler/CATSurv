\title{Likelihood of offering specific response}
\usage{
likelihood(cat_df, t)
}
\arguments{
\item{cat_df}{An object of \code{Cat} class}

\item{t}{A numeric for possible value of theta (position on the latent scale of interest)}

\item{items}{A vector containing the index of the question items we want to include in the likelihood calculations}
}
\value{
A value of the likelihood of each respondent offering spcific response
}
\description{
This function returns the value of likelihood of a person with ability parameter \eqn{\theta} having offered the specific response profile stored in answers conditional on the item-level parameters.
}
\details{
Letting \eqn{q_i(\theta_j)=1-p_i(\theta_j)}, the likelihood function associated with the responses profile \eqn{y_j} is..
\deqn{L(\theta_j|\mathbf{y}_{j})=\prod^{j}_{i=1}p_i(\theta_j)^{y_{ij}}q_i(\theta_j)^{(1-y_{ij}}}, where \eqn{y_j} is evaluated based only on the questions the respondet has actually had opportunity to answer
